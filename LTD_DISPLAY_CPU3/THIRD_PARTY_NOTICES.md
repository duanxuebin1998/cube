## DejaVu Sans Mono 西里尔字母点阵子集

- 使用位置：`Application/display/font_cyrillic.c`
- 上游字族：DejaVu Sans Mono
- 上游项目：<https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts>
- 官方许可文件：<https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts/blob/master/LICENSE>
- 使用范围：俄语大写和小写西里尔字母，共66个字形；码点为`U+0401`、`U+0410..U+042F`、`U+0430..U+044F`和`U+0451`
- 生成口径：以12 px字形栅格化为8x16显示窗口中的14行有效单色点阵，每个字形保存14字节；固件只分发生成后的点阵子集，不分发TTF/SFD字体文件

当前仓库未保存当时用于栅格化的DejaVu Sans Mono TTF文件、上游发布版本、文件哈希、栅格化工具版本以及hinting等渲染参数，因此不能从当前点阵反推或声明具体上游版本。下面的链接和许可正文用于标识上游项目及适用许可，不代表点阵由该仓库当前`master`版本生成。后续如需重新生成字形，应把输入字体文件、版本、SHA-256和生成命令一并归档。

发布包含该点阵子集的CPU3固件或源代码时，应在交付包中保留本文件。

以下为DejaVu官方仓库`LICENSE`的完整正文：

AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright

The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now freely
available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
cooperation
of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&Y.
Members of this consortium include:

Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
held by
the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
given a different name.
